## Bio

Thomaz Bastiaanssen is originally from the Netherlands where he studied Biology at the University of Utrecht. He moved to Ireland to start a PhD in bioinformatics under the supervision of Prof. John Cryan, Prof. Ted Dinan and Dr. Marcus Claesson. The topic of his thesis was the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Specifically, the focus was to understand what measurable aspects of the microbiome-gut-brain axis are the most informative to study in the context of health and disease. After graduating in 2021, Thomaz continues to work as a post-doc and the lead bioinformatician in Prof. Cryans lab. He is particularly interested in studying the temporal dynamics of the microbiome and understanding the microbiome from an ecosystem perspective.
