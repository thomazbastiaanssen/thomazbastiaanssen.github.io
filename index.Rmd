## About

I am a bioinformatician interested in the interplay between the gut microbiome and host mood and mental health. 

The focus of my research currently lies in understanding microbiome-gut-brain communication from a theoretical ecology/bioinformatics perspective. In particular, I am interested in understanding the role of stability and volatility of the gut microbiome in anxiety and depression and in integrating different types of â€˜omics data in a biologically interpretable manner. 

As a bioinformatician, I value clear and easily interpretable analysis of complex data in order to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
I'm currently working as a post-doc and the lead bioinformatician in Prof. Cryans lab.
